This is a "Pomodoro Timer" (also known as "25 + 5 Clock") for FreeCodeCamp.com Front End Library Certification. It didn't pass all the 29 tests due to the version of ReactJS I used for this challenge. But the code works correctly. You can see it on [React App](https://nathalycavalcante.github.io/pomodoro_timer_FCC/) and on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/nathaly_ylahtan/full/MWVddQg).
